# happy_planet_index_2016
The Happy Planet Index (HPI) is an index of human well-being and environmental impact that was introduced by NEF, a UK-based economic think tank promoting social, economic and environmental justice. The index is weighted to give progressively higher scores to nations with lower ecological footprints. I downloaded the 2016 dataset from HPI website. My goal is to find correlations between several variables, then use clustering technic to seprarate these 140 countries into different clusters, according to happiness, wealth, life expectancy and carbon emissions.
